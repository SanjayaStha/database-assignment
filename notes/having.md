# **üìö SQL Practice Course: Using the `HAVING` Clause**
---

## **üìñ Module 1: Understanding the `HAVING` Clause**
### ‚úÖ **What is `HAVING` in SQL?**
- The `HAVING` clause is used to **filter groups** after the `GROUP BY` clause.  
- Difference between **WHERE vs HAVING**  
- `HAVING` works with **aggregate functions** like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.

### ‚úÖ **Syntax of `HAVING`**
```sql
SELECT column, AGG_FUNCTION(column)
FROM table
GROUP BY column
HAVING condition;
```

### ‚úÖ **Basic Example**
Find departments where the **average salary is greater than 5000**:
```sql
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING AVG(Salary) > 5000;
```

---

## **üìñ Module 2: Multi-Table Setup for Practice**
We'll use **three tables**:  

### **üîπ Employees Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT,
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```

### **üîπ Departments Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### **üîπ Projects Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Projects (
    ProjectID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProjectName VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT
);
```

## **üîπ Basic `HAVING` Clause Practice**
1Ô∏è‚É£ Get all departments where **more than 5 employees** work.  
```sql
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(EmployeeID) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID
HAVING COUNT(EmployeeID) > 5;
```
---
2Ô∏è‚É£ Find departments where the **average salary is above 6000**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Show departments where **total salary exceeds 50,000**.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Find employees who appear **more than once** in the table.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ List departments where **minimum salary is below 3000**.  

---

## **üîπ `HAVING` with Multiple Joins**
6Ô∏è‚É£ Find departments where **more than 3 projects are assigned**.  
```sql
SELECT d.DepartmentName, COUNT(p.ProjectID) AS ProjectCount
FROM Departments d
JOIN Projects p ON d.DepartmentID = p.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName
HAVING COUNT(p.ProjectID) > 3;
```
---
7Ô∏è‚É£ Show departments where the **total salary is greater than 100,000**.  
8Ô∏è‚É£ List projects where the **average employee salary is more than 7000**.  
9Ô∏è‚É£ Find departments with **at least one project and more than 10 employees**.  
üîü Show projects where the **sum of employee salaries exceeds 50,000**.  

---

## **üîπ Advanced Queries with `HAVING` and Aggregations**
1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Show departments with **more than 2 employees earning above 8000**.  
1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Find projects where the **highest-paid employee earns over 9000**.  
1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Get projects where the **average salary of employees is below 4000**.  
1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Find departments where **more than half the employees earn above 5000**.  
1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Show departments where **total number of employees is between 5 and 15**.  

---

## **üîπ `HAVING` with Nested Queries**
1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Find projects where **total employee salary is greater than the average salary of all employees**.  
1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ Show departments where the **number of employees is more than the average number of employees per department**.  
1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ List departments where **total salary is above the company's average salary**.  
1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ Find projects where **employees work on more than one project**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Show departments where the **highest salary is more than twice the lowest salary**.  

---

## **üîπ Complex Queries with Multiple Conditions**
2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Find projects where **more than 3 employees earn above 6000 and total salary is above 30,000**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Show departments where **the sum of salaries is greater than the average salary multiplied by the number of employees**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Find employees working on projects **that have an average salary below 5000**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Show projects where **the number of employees is between 5 and 10 and total salary exceeds 40,000**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ List departments where **no employee earns below 4000**.  

---

## **üîπ `HAVING` with Date Filters**
2Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Show projects started in the last 2 years where **total salary exceeds 100,000**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ Find departments where **employees hired in the last 5 years have an average salary above 7000**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ List employees who joined before 2020 and earn above the average salary.  
2Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ Show departments where the **oldest employee has worked for more than 10 years**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Find projects with employees who joined **after 2018 and have an average salary above 6000**.
