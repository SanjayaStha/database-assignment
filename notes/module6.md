# **Module 6: Case Study and Project**

## **6.1 Analyzing the Case Study**

### **Requirements Gathering**

Requirements gathering is the initial phase where you understand the problem domain, the needs of the stakeholders, and the functionalities required by the system. This step involves:

1. **Identifying Business Needs**: Engage with stakeholders to understand their expectations and business processes.
   - Example: For an e-commerce application, stakeholders might need features like user management, order management, and inventory tracking.

2. **Defining Use Cases**: Document how the system will be used. This can include different user roles (admin, customer, etc.) and their actions within the system.
   - Example: A customer can view products, add them to the cart, and place an order. An admin can manage inventory and process orders.

3. **Understanding Data Flow**: Determine what data will flow through the system, how it will be captured, stored, and processed.
   - Example: Product details (name, price, description) will be stored in a product table, and customer orders will be linked to products via an order table.

4. **Identifying Constraints**: Consider any constraints or limitations in terms of performance, security, and database size.
   - Example: The database should be able to handle thousands of products and user transactions per day without performance degradation.

### **Identifying Entities and Relationships**

Entities are objects or concepts that are represented as tables in a relational database. Relationships define how entities are related to each other. Identifying entities and relationships is essential for database design.

1. **Entities**: These are typically nouns, such as `Customer`, `Product`, `Order`, etc.
2. **Relationships**: These define how entities are connected. Common relationships include:
   - One-to-One: A customer can have one shipping address.
   - One-to-Many: A customer can place many orders.
   - Many-to-Many: A product can appear in many orders, and an order can have many products (requiring a junction table).

Example:
- **Customer** (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email)
- **Order** (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate)
- **Product** (ProductID, Name, Price)
- **OrderDetail** (OrderID, ProductID, Quantity)

## **6.2 Database Design**

### **Creating ERDs for the Case Study**

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) visually represents the entities and their relationships. ERDs include:

1. **Entities**: Represented as rectangles, each entity becomes a table in the database.
2. **Attributes**: Represented as ovals, these are the properties or columns of the table.
3. **Relationships**: Represented as diamonds, showing how entities are related.

**Steps to create an ERD:**

1. **Identify Entities**: List all the entities in the case study, such as `Customer`, `Product`, `Order`, etc.
2. **Define Attributes**: Determine the attributes for each entity. For example, `Customer` might have `CustomerID`, `FirstName`, and `Email`.
3. **Identify Relationships**: Determine how entities relate to each other. For example, a `Customer` can place multiple `Orders`, creating a one-to-many relationship.
4. **Define Cardinality**: Define the nature of the relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).

**Example of ERD for an E-commerce System:**

- **Customer**: CustomerID (PK), FirstName, LastName, Email
- **Order**: OrderID (PK), CustomerID (FK), OrderDate
- **Product**: ProductID (PK), Name, Price
- **OrderDetail**: OrderID (FK), ProductID (FK), Quantity

### **Normalizing the Database**

Normalization is the process of organizing the database to reduce redundancy and dependency. The goal is to divide large tables into smaller ones and define relationships to eliminate redundant data.

1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Ensure that the table has no repeating groups and that each column contains atomic values (indivisible values).
   - Example: Instead of storing multiple phone numbers in one column, each phone number should be stored in a separate row.

2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Achieve 1NF and ensure that all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key.
   - Example: If a table stores both order details and product details, the product name should be stored in a separate product table and referenced by a foreign key.

3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Achieve 2NF and remove transitive dependencies, meaning that non-key attributes should depend only on the primary key.
   - Example: If the `Order` table includes the `Customer` address, this information should be moved to the `Customer` table to avoid redundancy.

## **6.3 Database Implementation**

### **Writing SQL Scripts to Create and Populate Tables**

Once the database design is complete, you can begin implementing it by writing SQL scripts to create tables and populate them with data.

1. **Creating Tables**: Write SQL commands to create each table, including columns, data types, and constraints (primary key, foreign key, etc.).

**Example**:
CREATE TABLE Customer ( CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY, FirstName VARCHAR(50), LastName VARCHAR(50), Email VARCHAR(100) );

CREATE TABLE Product ( ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(100), Price DECIMAL(10, 2) );

CREATE TABLE Order ( OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY, CustomerID INT, OrderDate DATE, FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customer(CustomerID) );

CREATE TABLE OrderDetail ( OrderID INT, ProductID INT, Quantity INT, PRIMARY KEY (OrderID, ProductID), FOREIGN KEY (OrderID) REFERENCES Order(OrderID), FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Product(ProductID) );

2. **Populating Tables**: Insert sample data into the tables to test the functionality.

**Example**:
INSERT INTO Customer (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email) VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'johndoe@example.com');

INSERT INTO Product (ProductID, Name, Price) VALUES (101, 'Laptop', 799.99);

INSERT INTO Order (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate) VALUES (1001, 1, '2025-01-01');

INSERT INTO OrderDetail (OrderID, ProductID, Quantity) VALUES (1001, 101, 2);

### **Designing Queries for Case-Specific Operations**

Once the database is implemented, you need to design queries that support the specific use cases identified during requirements gathering.

1. **Retrieving Data**: Write SELECT queries to retrieve data based on specific conditions.

**Example**: Retrieve all orders placed by a customer.
SELECT OrderID, OrderDate FROM Order WHERE CustomerID = 1;

Copy code

2. **Inserting Data**: Design queries for adding new records.

**Example**: Add a new product to the inventory.
INSERT INTO Product (ProductID, Name, Price) VALUES (102, 'Smartphone', 499.99);

markdown
Copy code

3. **Updating Data**: Write UPDATE queries to modify existing records.

**Example**: Update the price of a product.
UPDATE Product SET Price = 459.99 WHERE ProductID = 102;

4. **Deleting Data**: Write DELETE queries to remove records.

**Example**: Delete an order from the system.
DELETE FROM Order WHERE OrderID = 1001;

The final presentation is an opportunity to showcase the database solution you have implemented. This should include:

1. **Overview of the Problem**: Briefly explain the business problem or case study.
2. **ERD and Database Design**: Present the ERD and explain the design choices you made, such as why you chose certain entities, attributes, and relationships.

1. **Database Normalization**: Explain how normalization was used to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.
2. **Query Optimization**: Discuss how you optimized queries for better performance and efficiency.
3. **Use of Constraints**: Explain the use of primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints to maintain data consistency.
4. **Scalability and Security**: Discuss how the database design can handle growing data and user traffic. Explain any security measures, such as user permissions and access controls.

In your final presentation, focus on the practicality and effectiveness of your design, as well as how it meets the requirements of the case study.
