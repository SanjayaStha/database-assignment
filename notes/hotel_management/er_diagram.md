## **2Ô∏è‚É£ ER Diagram**  

Here is a **simplified representation of the ER diagram:**  

```
[Branch] ‚Üê (1) --- (1) ‚Üí [Manager]  
[Branch] ‚Üê (1) --- (M) ‚Üí [Room]  
[Customer] ‚Üê (1) --- (M) ‚Üí [Reservation] ‚Üê (M) --- (M) ‚Üí [Room]  
[Reservation] ‚Üê (1) --- (1) ‚Üí [Invoice]  
[Customer] ‚Üê (1) --- (M) ‚Üí [Review] ‚Üê (1) --- (1) ‚Üí [Branch]  
```
‚úÖ **Legend:**  
- **(1) --- (M)** means **One-to-Many** relationship  
- **(M) --- (M)** means **Many-to-Many** relationship

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Tables and Attributes**
Now, let‚Äôs define the necessary **tables and attributes**:

);
```
‚úÖ Links **each manager** to **one branch**.
